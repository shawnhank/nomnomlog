# 🍽️ NomNomLog – Your Personalized Meal Memory Bank


## 📜 Intro

  Picture this: You had a great meal at a restaurant. You were having such a good time with friends and family and you forgot to jot down the details? Now you want a repeat experience, but you can't remember the restaurant or amazing meal/dish you had. What do you do?

  NomNomLog is your private dining diary — a full-stack MERN application that helps you track, rate, and reflect on meals you've eaten at restaurants or ordered for delivery. 

  Unlike public review platforms like Yelp or Google, NomNomLog is designed for personal use, letting you document what you ordered, where you ate it, and whether it was worth repeating.

  It's perfect for frequent diners, business travelers, and foodies who want to make smarter decisions when dining out or ordering in. While delivery apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash track your order history, they don't let you add personal notes about what was good, bad, or worth reordering.

  NomNomLog is your personal, and fully private dining diary — a smarter way to remember what you liked (or didn't) at restaurants. There are no social features or public posts ensuring users can be candid in their comments and notes.  Replace you scattered Apple Notes, spreadsheets, and takeout guesswork with a searchable, organized, and private log of meals you've eaten across restaurants.

  NomNomLog helps users track:

    * What they ate, where and when they ate it, how much it cost and how much they liked it
    * Whether they'd order it again — or avoid it next time
    * Private Taste Records complete with personal notes, photos, and tags to make each meal searchable and memorable 

  Think: **Goodreads for food**, or your **private Yelp**, focused solely on your tastes and dietary requirements.

## 🚀 Idea-to-Market Tips & Pitfalls

  ### 🧳 Developer Notes & Guidance

   - **Mobile-First UI**: Fast forms, thumb-friendly buttons
    - **Avoid Overengineering**: MVP = memory + rating + search
    - **Don't Be Social**: This is private, not Yelp.
        * (TBD: Allow sharing with other nomnomlog users?)
    - **Support Export Early**: Makes data feel "owned"
    - **Migrate Later**: External APIs can be phased in
    - Keep forms fast and simple
    - Allow export early to boost trust
    - API integrations can be phased in

  ### Start Simple
   
    - Restaurant name, dish name, thumbs, and date is enough for MVP
    - No AI, analytics, or deep APIs in phase one

  ### Pitfalls to Avoid
   
    - 💸 API costs early (Yelp, Google Places)
    - 🧼 Data duplication from messy entry
    - 🤯 Confusion when empty (zero meals logged)

  ### Best Practices
  
    - Use autocomplete for restaurant entry
    - Preload 2–3 meals in demo accounts
    - Show sample meal cards during onboarding
