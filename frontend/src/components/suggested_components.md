# Augment Code agent prompt

I need help migrating my NomNomLog React project from custom CSS to Tailwind CSS. Please analyze these directories and files:

1. Components: /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/src/components
2. Pages: /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/src/pages
3. Configuration files:
   - /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/vite.config.js
   - /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/tailwind.config.js
   - /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/postcss.config.js
4. Catalyst components: /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/src/components/catalyst
5. Custom Tailwind UI components: /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/src/components/Breadcrumbs

For this migration:

1. First, verify that my Tailwind configuration is correct and suggest any necessary updates, especially ensuring dark mode is properly configured
2. Identify all components using custom CSS styles (either inline or imported CSS files)
3. Create a prioritized list of all components that need migration, starting with:
   - Global/layout components (Navbar, Footer, etc.)
   - Commonly used UI components (Buttons, Cards, etc.)
   - Page-specific components
4. Process as many components as possible in this session, focusing on the highest-priority ones first
5. For each component, convert custom CSS to equivalent Tailwind CSS classes
6. Follow mobile-first design principles (base classes for mobile, then sm:, md:, lg: modifiers)
7. Ensure all components support dark mode using the dark: variant classes
8. Preserve all functionality and layout
9. For each CSS file that's no longer needed after migration:
   - Replace all content with the comment: "/* This file can be deleted as we've converted to Tailwind CSS */"
   - Add the file path to a list of files that can be safely deleted later

When migrating components:
- Leverage existing Catalyst components from /components/catalyst/ whenever possible (documentation: https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs)
- For components not available in Catalyst, check if I've already added a custom Tailwind UI component in /components/
- If a needed component is not in either location, check https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui for a suitable component
- Add any suggested components from Tailwind UI to the file: /Users/swh2/code/ga/projects/nomnomlog/frontend/src/components/suggested_components.md
- Only create new custom components when nothing suitable exists in any of these sources

I want to follow React best practices. As you analyze the codebase:
- Identify opportunities to create reusable components
- Suggest where component composition could improve code organization
- Note any patterns that could be extracted into shared components
- Recommend proper prop usage and component structure
- Ensure the dark/light mode toggle functionality is properly implemented

Testing strategy after migration:
- For each migrated component, provide a testing checklist that includes:
  1. Visual verification in both light and dark modes
  2. Responsive behavior testing at different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  3. Interaction testing (clicks, hovers, form inputs, etc.)
  4. Any specific functionality that needs verification

At the end of the session, provide a summary of:
1. Components that were successfully migrated
2. Components that still need migration (for a future session)
3. Any patterns or recommendations for continuing the migration process

Please start by reviewing my configuration files to ensure Tailwind is set up correctly, then provide the prioritized list of components before beginning the migration.

# Tailwind CSS Migration Progress

## ‚úÖ Successfully Migrated Components

### Core Layout & Navigation
- **NavBar** - Fully migrated with Headless UI components and dark mode support
- **App.jsx** - Using Tailwind layout classes with proper dark mode

- **MultiImageUploader** - Custom styling needed
- **TagSelector** - Custom styling needed
- **Button** (custom) - Should be replaced with Catalyst Button

### Utility Components
- **SignupForm** - Incomplete component file
- **LoginForm** - Incomplete component file
- **RestaurantForm** - Incomplete component file

## üìÅ CSS Files Marked for Deletion

The following CSS files have been converted to Tailwind and can be safely deleted:

- `frontend/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.css`
- `frontend/src/components/NavBar/NavBar.css`
- `frontend/src/components/MealCard/MealCard.css`
- `frontend/src/components/RestaurantCard/RestaurantCard.css`
